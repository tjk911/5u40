			<p>Speed may have been the biggest asset the Foley football team had going for it last season.</p>

			<p>This season, it may be size.</p>

			<p>The Falcons lost key offensive weapons Luke Kelvington and Tyler Beehler to graduation. Each participated in this past summer’s state all-star game and both ran legs on Foley’s Class A state champion 400-meter relay team last spring.</p>

			<p>Beehler also captured state titles in both the 100 and 200 dash as a junior and senior.</p>

			<p>Kelvington now plays at St. Cloud State while Beehler is at Iowa Western Community College.</p>

			<p>But if the Falcons’ team quickness may take a hit with their graduation, the team is expected to start an offensive line that averages 260 pounds across the front five.</p>

			<p>“We’ve got pretty decent size on our offensive line and we’ll have some pretty big running backs too,” said 6-foot-2, 355-pound senior guard Jeremy Moulzolf, a Times’ All-Area honorable mention pick who returns to anchor that group.</p>

			<p>“Between our line and our running backs, I think we only have one guy over 200 pounds. So we have that going for us.”</p>

			<p>Foley returns just three starters on offense, but two of them — Moulzolf and 6-1, 280-pound senior tackle Dylan Stang — play up front.</p>

			<?php include('page/ad.php') ?>

			<p>“We have guys who have played a year now and they’ve brought a lot of maturity to the group,” said Falcons coach Larry Herm, who begins his 26th season at the school. “They’re now like teachers in a way and it’s been cool to watch that.”</p>

			<p>The team also returns its starting quarterback in junior Kyle Kipka, but the rest of the skill positions will be relatively inexperienced.</p>

			<p>“Yes, we have some new people who maybe don’t have the experience that the guys we lost did,” said Kipka, who threw for 515 yards and three touchdowns a year ago. “But they’ve been working hard and I think they’re going to respond well to the challenge.”</p>

			<p>Defensively, Foley returns three starters in senior linebackers Jon Greener and Carter Nielsen and senior cornerback Cameron Jurek. In all, the Falcons lost six players who were Times’ All-Area or honorable mention selections.</p>

			<p>“We’re moving on,” Herm said. “We know what the guys we had last year did. But now it’s time to move forward.</p>

			<p>“With all the talent we lost, we know there are some who maybe don’t expect much from us. But these kids have heard that enough and they’re tired of it. They’re ready to show what they can do.”</p>

			<p>“We just have to keep doing what we’ve been doing,” Moulzolf said. “We have to keep working hard and doing the things we’re supposed to do.”</p>
