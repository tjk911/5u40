			<p>It may sound like a bit like hyperbole, but Alex Van Heel is thinking people aren’t expecting much from St. Cloud Tech this season.</p>

			<p>“I think there are low expectations for us because of the huge senior class last year,” the senior cornerback said.</p>

			<p>True, that really was a strong senior class that went 5-4 in 2013, but everybody with a “Tech” on the front of their uniforms is thinking 2014 should be OK, too.</p>

			<p>“Our numbers are down a little bit,” said Jake Martig, a senior wide receiver who led the Tigers with 15 receptions in 2013.</p>

			<p>“We’ll have to work with it a little and some guys are going to have to step up.”</p>

			<p>There are 15 seniors and 14 juniors out and not many of them played a lot last year.</p>

			<p>However, the coaching staff thinks there is a good nucleus, as well as a very talented sophomore class.</p>

			<p>That starts at quarterback, where sophomore Chris Backes begins the season as the starter after starting in Tech’s playoff game last season.</p>

			<p>He should have at least three talented targets, including Martig and Andrew Weber, who saw varsity time.</p>

			<p>The player to watch is Jake Mussman.</p>

			<p>And while you’re at it, check out his “little” brother, Jack Mussman.</p>

			<p>The Mussmans are transfers from Grand Forks, N.D. Their father, Chris Mussman, is the St. Cloud State’s new co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.</p>

			<p>Jake is 6-foot-5, 190 pounds and a wide receiver who is a college basketball prospect. He was one of the top players in North Dakota as a junior.</p>

			<p>Jack is a sophomore left tackle listed at 6-4 and 335 with good athleticism and strength.</p>

			<p>He started as a freshman last year.</p>

			<?php include('page/ad.php') ?>

			<p>Brennan Paulsen also is back after leading the Tigers with 622 yards rushing last season.</p>

			<p>“It’s going really good,” Paulsen said of preseason practice. “All of our players are getting more fine-tuned.</p>

			<p>“The season is looking real good.”</p>

			<p>On offense, the key may be how the offensive line comes around. It has decent size, but is relatively untested.</p>

			<p>“I’m ready to replace them (last year’s seniors),” senior offensive lineman Trey Slagstad said. “I’ve worked my butt off all year.”</p>

			<p>The defense is even more untested. Fourteen of the top 16 tacklers from last season are gone.</p>

			<p>The two returnees are defensive end Lucas Muller (11 solos, 35 assisted tackles, four tackles for loss) and Van Heel (12 solos, 13 assisted).</p>

			<p>Everyone else will be new.</p>

			<p>“We don’t have a lot of them, but our seniors have worked hard,” said head coach Gregg Martig, who is Jake’s dad. “We do like our skill guys.</p>

			<p>“The group is very talented. We should be overall more skilled.</p>

			<p>“At one point last year, we had 11 seniors starting on defense. Muller played a lot on defensive line and he should be really good.”</p>

			<p>Martig’ is also expecting some big things from Van Heel and the rest of the Tigers, even if everybody else may not be.</p>

			<p>“Our sophomore class has really good numbers (30 players),” Martig said.</p>

			<p>“Some of them will have a chance to play this year.”</p>
