			<p>The sight of an athletic 6-foot-5, 230-pound football player walking down a high school hall can be intimidating.</p>

			<p>When senior Jared Streit walks down the halls of Eden Valley-Watkins High School, though, there’s normally a positive reaction. If he is walking around after school days end, he is one of three students who are talking to teachers and seeing if they need any help or work done on their computers.</p>

			<p>“We update computers, clean them, change them out,” Streit said of his IT assistance. “Whatever the teachers need.”</p>

			<p>Streit’s also on the student council, in the investment club and in a leadership class.</p>

			<p>“He’s always helping the younger kids,” senior Cody Schlangen said. “He’s always trying to help the team.”</p>

			<p>If that sounds like the characteristics of an oldest child, you’ve picked up on something. Streit has three younger brothers: Jacob is a sophomore, Justin is an eighth-grader and Josh is a sixth-grader.</p>

			<p>“I try to treat everybody the same,” Streit said. “Just because I’m older doesn’t mean that I’m right about everything.”</p>

			<p>Streit has been getting a lot of interest from college football recruiters. Last season, he started at tight end, defensive end and kicker. He had 26 receptions and 11 sacks and then took part in summer football camps at North Dakota State and the University of Minnesota.</p>

			<?php include('page/ad.php') ?>

			<p>North Dakota State, South Dakota State, North Dakota and Drake are among his NCAA Division I suitors. He’s also been a varsity basketball player since the eighth grade and has talked to St. John’s about playing both sports there.</p>

			<p>“He kind of emerged last season in football,” coach Jon Thielen said. “But in basketball, he started taking off and people started to recognize his athleticism.”</p>

			<p>Added Thielen: “He’s earned everything he’s getting because he’s in the weight room a lot and by going to camps.”</p>

			<p>He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds at the North Dakota State camp and in 4.8 at the start of fall practice.</p>

			<p>He is one of six starters back on offense and one of three returning linemen. The Eagles went into camp looking for a starting quarterback. Junior Travis Thielen and sophomore Reese Jansen, who both played wide receiver and defensive back last season, battled for the starting position.</p>

			<p>“They’re not real big, but athletic,” Jon Thielen said of the quarterbacks. “They’re probably the most athletic quarterbacks we’ve had in a little while.</p>

			<p>“They can do a lot of different things, running and throwing.”</p>

			<p>The Eagles have seven starters back on defense. But there are 42 players in grades 9-12, so the hope is that the experienced players stay healthy.</p>
