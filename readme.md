Prep Football '14
==============

The Times' annual prep football tab, in digital form. 

Live version viewable here: http://www.sctimes.com/prepfootball

First digital, responsive, football tab was launched in 2013 and viewable here: http://archive.sctimes.com/projects/prepfootball/

Project code
==============

Project is primarily running on Foundation. Parallax was done with Skrollr.js, dynamic loading was achieved with a slightly tweaked dynamicpage.js.

Responsive tables code from Zurb with tweaks for different breakpoints.

To-do
==============

* Cleanup and optimize code - heavy load on the page, CSS could do with additional cleaning
* Templating pages more
* Tweaking styling - a great deal of Foundation's basic stylings still remain
* Adapting project over to rdpapp
* Work on the ad code a little more - somewhat haphazard implementation right now
