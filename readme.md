5 Under 40
==============

The Times' annual 5 Under 40 awards, in digital form. 

Live version viewable here: http://www.sctimes.com/5under40

First digital, responsive, 5 under 40 awards was launched in 2013 and viewable here: http://archive.sctimes.com/projects/5under40/

Project code
==============

Original awards page was coded entirely in HTML + CSS, terrible idea, attempting to template it using base "Football tab" code. 

Project is primarily running on Foundation. Parallax was done with Skrollr.js, dynamic loading was achieved with a slightly tweaked dynamicpage.js.

Responsive tables code from Zurb with tweaks for different breakpoints.

To-do
==============

* ~~Cleanup additional stuff from Prep football that's useless for 5u40~~
* Cleanup and optimize code - heavy load on the page, CSS could do with additional cleaning
* Templating pages more
* Tweaking styling - a great deal of Foundation's basic stylings still remain
* Adapting project over to rdpapp
* ~~Work on the ad code a little more - somewhat haphazard implementation right now~~
